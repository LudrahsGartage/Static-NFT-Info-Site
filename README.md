# Static NFT Info Site
A static NFT Information side made using modern html and css concepts such as utility classes, semantic html, and flexbox.  
It also uses psuedo selectors and better html/css for accessibility reasons, such as using links instead of buttons. 
Was made along with Scrimba's interactive css course.
